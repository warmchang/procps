COMPATIBILITY

    This code is intended for use with Linux 2.2.xx, 2.4.xx,
    2.5.xx, and hopefully all future kernels. You should be
    running a system with libc 6, but libc 5 might work too.

INSTALLATION

    make
    make install

    Only the second ("make install") is needed if you just
    want to build and install procps in the normal way.

    If you wish to test before installing, use the scripts
    named t, v, and p to ensure that the correct libproc
    (the new one) is used during your testing.

    You may set SKIP to avoid building or installing things.
    For example:

    make SKIP='/bin/kill /usr/share/man/man1/kill.1' install

    Use SHARED=0 to build procps without shared libraries.
    This may be useful for installing in your home directory.

    make SHARED=0 DESTDIR=$HOME install

    Suppose you wanted to install stuff in strange places.
    You might do something like this:

    make usr/bin=/tmp/fff/iii/ DESTDIR=/tmp/fff install="install -D" ldconfig=echo install

BUG REPORTS

    Debian users should use the Debian bug tracking system.
    Email to albert@users.sf.net or csmall@debian.org or
    procps-feedback@lists.sf.net will also work.
