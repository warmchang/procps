.SH SYNOPSIS
.\" ----------------------------------------------------------------------
\*(WE \*(CL

The traditional switches `\-' and whitespace are optional.

.\" ----------------------------------------------------------------------
.SH DESCRIPTION
.\" ----------------------------------------------------------------------
The \*(WE program provides a dynamic real-time view of a running system.
It can display\fB system\fR summary information as well as a list of
\*(TT currently being managed by the Linux kernel.
The types of system summary information shown and the types, order and
size of information displayed for processes are all user configurable
and that configuration can be made persistent across restarts.

The program provides a limited interactive interface for process
manipulation as well as a much more extensive interface for personal
configuration \*(Em encompassing every aspect of its operation.
And while \*(WE is referred to throughout this document, you are free
to name the program anything you wish.
That new name, possibly an alias, will then be reflected on \*(We's
display and used when reading and writing a \*(CF.

.SS Operation
.\" ----------------------------------------------------------------------
When operating \*(We, the two most important keys are the help (h or ?)
key and quit (`q') key.
Alternatively, you could simply use the traditional interrupt key (^C)
when you're done.

When started for the first time, you'll be presented with these traditional
elements on the main \*(We screen: 1) Summary Area; 2) Fields/Columns Header;
3) Task Area.
Each of these will be explored in the sections that follow.
There is also an Input/Message line between the Summary Area and Columns
Header which needs no further explanation.

The main \*(We screen is \fIgenerally\fR quite adaptive to changes in
terminal dimensions under X-Windows.
Other \*(We screens may be less so, especially those with static text.
It ultimately depends, however, on your particular window manager and
terminal emulator.
There may be occasions when their view of terminal size and current contents
differs from \*(We's view, which is always based on operating system calls.

Following any re-size operation, if a \*(We screen is corrupted, appears
incomplete or disordered, simply typing something innocuous like a
punctuation character or cursor motion key will usually restore it.
In extreme cases, the following sequence almost certainly will:
.nf
       \fIkey/cmd  objective \fR
       ^Z       \fBsuspend\fR \*(We
       fg       \fBresume\fR \*(We
       <Left>   force a screen \fBredraw\fR (if necessary)
.fi

But if the display is still corrupted, there is one more step you could try.
Insert this command after \*(We has been suspended but before resuming it.
.nf
       \fIkey/cmd  objective \fR
       reset    restore your \fBterminal settings\fR
.fi

\*(NT the width of \*(We's display will be limited to \*(WX positions.
Displaying all fields requires \*(WF characters.
Remaining screen width is usually allocated to any variable width columns
currently visible.
The variable width columns, such as COMMAND, are noted in topic
3a. DESCRIPTIONS of Fields.
Actual output width may also be influenced by the \-w switch, which is
discussed in topic 1. COMMAND\-LINE Options.

Lastly, some of \*(We's screens or functions require the use of cursor
motion keys like the standard \*(KAs plus the Home, End, PgUp and PgDn keys.
If your terminal or emulator does not provide those keys, the following
combinations are accepted as alternatives:
.nf
      \fI key      equivalent-keys \fR
       Left     alt +\fB h \fR
       Down     alt +\fB j \fR
       Up       alt +\fB k \fR
       Right    alt +\fB l \fR
       Home     alt + ctrl +\fB h \fR
       PgDn     alt + ctrl +\fB j \fR
       PgUp     alt + ctrl +\fB k \fR
       End      alt + ctrl +\fB l \fR
.fi

The \fBUp\fR and \fBDown\fR \*(KAs have special significance when prompted
for line input terminated with the <Enter> key.
Those keys, or their aliases, can be used to retrieve previous input lines
which can then be edited and re-input.
And there are four additional keys available with line oriented input.
.nf
      \fI key      special-significance \fR
       Up       recall \fBolder\fR strings for re-editing
       Down     recall \fBnewer\fR strings or \fBerase\fR entire line
       Insert   toggle between \fBinsert\fR and \fBovertype\fR modes
       Delete   character \fBremoved\fR at cursor, moving others left
       Home     jump to \fBbeginning\fR of input line
       End      jump to \fBend\fR of input line
.fi

.\" ......................................................................
.SS Linux Memory Types
.\" ----------------------------------------------------------------------
For our purposes there are three types of memory, and one is optional.
First is \*(MP, a limited resource where code and data must
reside when executed or referenced.
Next is the optional \*(MS, where modified (dirty) memory can be saved
and later retrieved if too many demands are made on \*(MP.
Lastly we have \*(MV, a nearly unlimited resource serving the
following goals:

.nf
   1. abstraction, free from physical memory addresses/limits
   2. isolation, every process in a separate address space
   3. sharing, a single mapping can serve multiple needs
   4. flexibility, assign a virtual address to a file
.fi

Regardless of which of these forms memory may take, all are managed as
pages (typically 4096 bytes) but expressed by default in \*(We as
KiB (kibibyte).
The memory discussed under topic `2c. MEMORY Usage' deals with \*(MP
and the \*(MS for the system as a whole.
The memory reviewed in topic `3. FIELDS / Columns Display'
embraces all three memory types, but for individual processes.

For each such process, every memory page is restricted to a single
quadrant from the table below.
Both \*(MP and \*(MV can include any of the four, while the \*(MS only
includes #1 through #3.
The memory in quadrant #4, when modified, acts as its own dedicated \*(MS.

.nf
                              \fBPrivate\fR | \fBShared\fR
                          \fB1\fR           |          \fB2\fR
     \fBAnonymous\fR  . stack               |
                . malloc()            |
                . brk()/sbrk()        | . POSIX shm*
                . mmap(PRIVATE, ANON) | . mmap(SHARED, ANON)
               -----------------------+----------------------
                . mmap(PRIVATE, fd)   | . mmap(SHARED, fd)
   \fBFile-backed\fR  . pgms/shared libs    |
                          \fB3\fR           |          \fB4\fR
.fi

The following may help in interpreting process level memory values displayed
as scalable columns and discussed under topic `3a. DESCRIPTIONS of Fields'.

.nf
   %MEM \- simply RES divided by total \*(MP
   CODE \- the `pgms' portion of quadrant \fB3\fR
   DATA \- the entire quadrant \fB1\fR portion of VIRT plus all
          explicit mmap file-backed pages of quadrant \fB3\fR
   RES  \- anything occupying \*(MP which, beginning with
          Linux-4.5, is the sum of the following three fields:
          RSan \- quadrant \fB1\fR pages, which include any
                 former quadrant \fB3\fR pages if modified
          RSfd \- quadrant \fB3\fR and quadrant \fB4\fR pages
          RSsh \- quadrant \fB2\fR pages
   RSlk \- subset of RES which cannot be swapped out (any quadrant)
   SHR  \- subset of RES (excludes \fB1\fR, includes all \fB2\fR & \fB4\fR, some \fB3\fR)
   SWAP \- potentially any quadrant except \fB4\fR
   USED \- simply the sum of RES and SWAP
   VIRT \- everything in-use and/or reserved (all quadrants)
.fi

\*(NT Even though program images and shared libraries are considered
\fIprivate\fR to a process, they will be accounted for as \fIshared\fR
(SHR) by the kernel.

.\" ----------------------------------------------------------------------
.SH 1. COMMAND-LINE Options
.\" ----------------------------------------------------------------------
The command-line syntax for \*(We consists of:

  \*(CL

The typically mandatory switch (`\-') and even whitespace are completely
optional.

.TP 5
\-\fBh\fR | \-\fBv\fR\ \ :\fIHelp/Version \fR
Show library version and the usage prompt, then quit.

.TP 5
\-\fBb\fR\ \ :\fIBatch-mode\fR operation \fR
Starts \*(We in Batch mode, which could be useful for sending output
from \*(We to other programs or to a file.
In this mode, \*(We will not accept input and runs until the iterations
limit you've set with the `\-n' \*(CO or until killed.

.TP 5
\-\fBc\fR\ \ :\fICommand-line/Program-name\fR toggle \fR
Starts \*(We with the last remembered `c' state reversed.
Thus, if \*(We was displaying command lines, now that field will show program
names, and vice versa.
\*(XC `c' \*(CI for additional information.

.TP 5
\-\fBd\fR\ \ :\fIDelay-time\fR interval as:\ \ \fB-d ss.t\fR (\fIsecs\fR.\fItenths\fR) \fR
Specifies the delay between screen updates, and overrides the corresponding
value in one's personal \*(CF or the startup default.
Later this can be changed with the `d' or `s' \*(CIs.

Fractional seconds are honored, but a negative number is not allowed.
In all cases, however, such changes are prohibited if \*(We is running
in Secure mode, except for root (unless the `s' \*(CO was used).
For additional information on Secure mode \*(Xt 6d. SYSTEM Restrictions File.

.TP 5
\-\fBe\fR\ \ :\fIEnforce-Task-Memory-Scaling\fR as:\ \ \fB-e  k\fR | \fBm\fR | \fBg\fR | \fBt\fR | \fBp\fR
Instructs \*(We to force \*(TA memory to be scaled as:
.nf
   k \- kibibytes
   m \- mebibytes
   g \- gibibytes
   t \- tebibytes
   p \- pebibytes
.fi

Later this can be changed with the `e' \*(CT.

.TP 5
\-\fBE\fR\ \ :\fIEnforce-Summary-Memory-Scaling\fR as:\ \ \fB-E  k\fR | \fBm\fR | \fBg\fR | \fBt\fR | \fBp\fR | \fBe\fR
Instructs \*(We to force \*(SA memory to be scaled as:
.nf
   k \- kibibytes
   m \- mebibytes
   g \- gibibytes
   t \- tebibytes
   p \- pebibytes
   e \- exbibytes
.fi

Later this can be changed with the `E' \*(CT.

.TP 5
\-\fBH\fR\ \ :\fIThreads-mode\fR operation \fR
Instructs \*(We to display individual threads.
Without this \*(CO a summation of all threads in each process is shown.
Later this can be changed with the `H' \*(CI.

.TP 5
\-\fBi\fR\ \ :\fIIdle-process\fR toggle \fR
Starts \*(We with the last remembered `i' state reversed.
When this toggle is \*F, tasks that have not used any \*(PU since the
last update will not be displayed.
For additional information regarding this toggle
\*(Xt 4c. TASK AREA Commands, SIZE.

.TP 5
\-\fBn\fR\ \ :\fINumber-of-iterations\fR limit as:\fB\ \ \-n number \fR
Specifies the maximum number of iterations, or frames, \*(We should
produce before ending.

.TP 5
\-\fBo\fR\ \ :\fIOverride-sort-field\fR as:\fB\ \ \-o fieldname \fR
Specifies the name of the field on which tasks will be sorted, independent
of what is reflected in the configuration file.
You can prepend a `+' or `\-' to the field name to also override the sort direction.
A leading `+' will force sorting high to low, whereas a `\-' will ensure a low to high
ordering.

This option exists primarily to support automated/scripted batch mode
operation.

.TP 5
\-\fBO\fR\ \ :\fIOutput-field-names \fR
This option acts as a form of help for the above \-o option.
It will cause \*(We to print each of the available field names on a
separate line, then quit.
Such names are subject to NLS (National Language Support) translation.

.TP 5
\-\fBp\fR\ \ :\fIMonitor-PIDs\fR mode as:\fB\ \ \-pN1 -pN2 ...\fR\ \ or\fB\ \ \-pN1,N2,N3 ... \fR
Monitor only processes with specified process IDs.
This option can be given up to \*(WP times, or you can provide a comma delimited
list with up to \*(WP pids.
Co-mingling both approaches is permitted.

A pid value of zero will be treated as the process id of the \*(We program
itself once it is running.

This is a \*(CO only and should you wish to return to normal operation,
it is not necessary to quit and restart \*(We \*(Em just issue any
of these \*(CIs: `=', `u' or `U'.

The `p', `u' and `U' \*(COs are mutually exclusive.

.TP 5
\-\fBs\fR\ \ :\fISecure-mode\fR operation \fR
Starts \*(We with secure mode forced, even for root.
This mode is far better controlled through a system \*(CF
(\*(Xt 6. FILES).

.TP 5
\-\fBS\fR\ \ :\fICumulative-time\fR toggle \fR
Starts \*(We with the last remembered `S' state reversed.
When Cumulative time mode is \*O, each process is listed with the \*(Pu
time that it and its dead children have used.
\*(XC `S' \*(CI for additional information regarding this mode.

.TP 5
\-\fBu\fR | \-\fBU\fR\ \ :\fIUser-filter-mode\fR as:\ \ \fB-u\fR | \fB-U number\fR or\fB name \fR
Display only processes with a user id or user name matching that given.
The `\-u' option matches on \fI effective\fR user whereas the `\-U' option
matches on\fI any\fR user (real, effective, saved, or filesystem).

Prepending an exclamation point (`!') to the user id or name instructs \*(We
to display only processes with users not matching the one provided.

The `p', `u' and `U' \*(COs are mutually exclusive.

.TP 5
\-\fBw\fR\ \ :\fIOutput-width-override\fR as:\ \ \fB-w\fR [\fB number\fR ] \fR
In Batch mode, when used without an argument \*(We will format
output using the COLUMNS= and LINES= environment variables, if set.
Otherwise, width will be fixed at the maximum \*(WX columns.
With an argument, output width can be decreased or increased (up to \*(WX)
but the number of rows is considered unlimited.

In normal display mode, when used without an argument \*(We will\fI attempt\fR
to format output using the COLUMNS= and LINES= environment variables, if set.
With an argument, output width can only be decreased, not increased.
Whether using environment variables or an argument with \-w, when\fI not\fR
in Batch mode actual terminal dimensions can never be exceeded.

\*(NT Without the use of this \*(CO, output width is always based on the
terminal at which \*(We was invoked whether or not in Batch mode.

.TP 5
\-\fB1\fR\ \ :\fISingle/Separate-Cpu-States\fR toggle \fR
Starts \*(We with the last remembered Cpu States portion of the \*(SA reversed.
Either all \*(Pu information will be displayed in a single line or
each \*(Pu will be displayed separately, depending on the state of the NUMA Node
\*(CT ('2').

\*(XC `1' and '2' \*(CIs for additional information.

.\" ----------------------------------------------------------------------
.SH 2. SUMMARY Display
.\" ----------------------------------------------------------------------
Each of the following three areas are individually controlled through
one or more \*(CIs.
\*(XT 4b. SUMMARY AREA Commands for additional information regarding
these provisions.

.\" ......................................................................
.SS 2a. UPTIME and LOAD Averages
.\" ----------------------------------------------------------------------
This portion consists of a single line containing:
.nf
    \fBprogram\fR or\fB window\fR name, depending on display mode
    current time and length of time since last boot
    total number of users
    system load avg over the last 1, 5 and 15 minutes
.fi

.\" ......................................................................
.SS 2b. TASK and CPU States
.\" ----------------------------------------------------------------------
This portion consists of a minimum of two lines.
In an SMP environment, additional lines can reflect individual \*(PU
state percentages.

Line 1 shows total\fB tasks\fR or\fB threads\fR, depending on the state
of the Threads-mode toggle.
That total is further classified as:
.nf
    running; sleeping; stopped; zombie
.fi

Line 2 shows \*(PU state percentages based on the interval since the
last refresh.

As a default, percentages for these individual categories are displayed.
Where two labels are shown below, those for more recent kernel versions
are shown first.
.nf
    \fBus\fR,\fB user\fR    : time running un-niced user processes
    \fBsy\fR,\fB system\fR  : time running kernel processes
    \fBni\fR,\fB nice\fR    : time running niced user processes
    \fBid\fR,\fB idle\fR    : time spent in the kernel idle handler
    \fBwa\fR,\fB IO-wait\fR : time waiting for I/O completion
    \fBhi\fR : time spent servicing hardware interrupts
    \fBsi\fR : time spent servicing software interrupts
    \fBst\fR : time stolen from this vm by the hypervisor
.fi

In the alternate cpu states display modes, beyond the first tasks/threads line,
an abbreviated summary is shown consisting of these elements:
.nf
              \fR a  \fR  b    \fR c \fR   d
    %Cpu(s):  \fB75.0\fR/25.0  \fB100\fR[ ...

.fi

Where: a) is the `user' (us + ni) percentage; b) is the `system'
(sy + hi + si) percentage; c) is the total; and d) is one of two
visual graphs of those representations.
\*(XT 4b. SUMMARY AREA Commands and the `t' command for additional information
on that special 4-way toggle.

.\" ......................................................................
.SS 2c. MEMORY Usage
.\" ----------------------------------------------------------------------
This portion consists of two lines which may express values in kibibytes (KiB)
through exbibytes (EiB) depending on the scaling factor enforced
with the `E' \*(CI.

As a default, Line 1 reflects \*(MP, classified as:
.nf
    total, free, used and buff/cache
.fi

Line 2 reflects mostly \*(MV, classified as:
.nf
    total, free, used and avail (which is \*(MP)
.fi

The \fBavail\fR number on line 2 is an estimation of \*(MP available for
starting new applications, without swapping.
Unlike the \fBfree\fR field, it attempts to account for readily reclaimable
page cache and memory slabs.
It is available on kernels 3.14, emulated on kernels 2.6.27+, otherwise
the same as \fBfree\fR.

In the alternate memory display modes, two abbreviated summary lines
are shown consisting of these elements:
.nf
              \fR a  \fR  b          c
    GiB Mem : \fB18.7\fR/15.738   [ ...
    GiB Swap: \fB 0.0\fR/7.999    [ ...
.fi

Where: a) is the percentage used; b) is the total available; and c) is one of two
visual graphs of those representations.

In the case of \*(MP, the percentage represents the \fBtotal\fR minus the estimated
\fBavail\fR noted above.
The `Mem' graph itself is divided between \fBused\fR and any remaining memory not
otherwise accounted for by \fBavail\fR.
\*(XT 4b. SUMMARY AREA Commands and the `m' command for additional information
on that special 4-way toggle.

This table may help in interpreting the scaled values displayed:
.nf
    KiB = kibibyte = 1024 bytes
    MiB = mebibyte = 1024 KiB = 1,048,576 bytes
    GiB = gibibyte = 1024 MiB = 1,073,741,824 bytes
    TiB = tebibyte = 1024 GiB = 1,099,511,627,776 bytes
    PiB = pebibyte = 1024 TiB = 1,125,899,906,842,624 bytes

.\" ----------------------------------------------------------------------
.\" ......................................................................
.SS 3a. DESCRIPTIONS of Fields
.\" ----------------------------------------------------------------------
Listed below are \*(We's available process fields (columns).
They are shown in strict ascii alphabetical order.
You may customize their position and whether or not they are displayable
with the `f' or `F' (Fields Management) \*(CIs.

Any field is selectable as the sort field, and you control whether they
are sorted high-to-low or low-to-high.
For additional information on sort provisions
\*(Xt 4c. TASK AREA Commands, SORTING.

The fields related to \*(MP or \*(MV reference `(KiB)' which is the
unsuffixed display mode.
Such fields may, however, be scaled from KiB through PiB.
That scaling is influenced via the `e' \*(CI or established for startup
through a build option.

.TP 4
 1.\fB %CPU \*(Em \*(PU Usage \fR
The task's share of the elapsed \*(PU time since the last screen update,
expressed as a percentage of total \*(PU time.

In a true SMP environment, if a process is multi-threaded and \*(We is
\fInot\fR operating in Threads mode, amounts greater than 100% may be
reported.
You toggle Threads mode with the `H' \*(CI.

Also for multi-processor environments, if Irix mode is \*F, \*(We
will operate in Solaris mode where a task's \*(Pu usage will be
divided by the total number of \*(PUs.
You toggle Irix/Solaris modes with the `I' \*(CI.

\*(NT When running in forest view mode (`V') with children
collapsed (`v'), this field will also include the \*(PU time of
those unseen children.
\*(XT 4c. TASK AREA Commands, CONTENT for more information regarding
the `V' and `v' toggles.

.TP 4
 2.\fB %MEM \*(Em Memory Usage (RES) \fR
A task's currently resident share of available \*(MP.

\*(XX.

.TP 4
 3.\fB CGNAME \*(Em Control Group Name \fR
The name of the control group to which a process belongs,
or `\-' if not applicable for that process.

This will typically be the last entry in the full list of control
groups as shown under the next heading (CGROUPS).
And as is true there, this field is also variable width.

.TP 4
 4.\fB CGROUPS \*(Em Control Groups \fR
The names of the control group(s) to which a process belongs,
or `\-' if not applicable for that process.

Control Groups provide for allocating resources (cpu, memory, network
bandwidth, etc.) among installation-defined groups of processes.
They enable fine-grained control over allocating, denying, prioritizing,
managing and monitoring those resources.

Many different hierarchies of cgroups can exist simultaneously on a system
and each hierarchy is attached to one or more subsystems.
A subsystem represents a single resource.

\*(NT The CGROUPS field, unlike most columns, is not fixed-width.
When displayed, it plus any other variable width columns will be allocated
all remaining screen width (up to the maximum \*(WX characters).
Even so, such variable width fields could still suffer truncation.
\*(XT 5c. SCROLLING a Window for additional information on accessing
any truncated data.

.TP 4
 5.\fB CODE \*(Em Code Size (KiB) \fR
The amount of \*(MP currently devoted to executable code, also known
as the Text Resident Set size or TRS.

\*(XX.

.TP 4
 6.\fB COMMAND \*(Em Command\fB Name\fR or Command\fB Line \fR
Display the command line used to start a task or the name of the associated
program.
You toggle between command\fI line\fR and\fI name\fR with `c', which is both
a \*(CO and an \*(CI.

When you've chosen to display command lines, processes without a command
line (like kernel threads) will be shown with only the program name in
brackets, as in this example:
    \fR[kthreadd]

This field may also be impacted by the forest view display mode.
\*(XC `V' \*(CI for additional information regarding that mode.

\*(NT The COMMAND field, unlike most columns, is not fixed-width.
When displayed, it plus any other variable width columns will be allocated
all remaining screen width (up to the maximum \*(WX characters).
Even so, such variable width fields could still suffer truncation.
This is especially true for this field when command lines are being
displayed (the `c' \*(CI.)
\*(XT 5c. SCROLLING a Window for additional information on accessing
any truncated data.

.TP 4
 7.\fB DATA \*(Em Data + Stack Size (KiB) \fR
The amount of private memory \fIreserved\fR by a process.
It is also known as the Data Resident Set or DRS.
Such memory may not yet be mapped to \*(MP (RES) but will always be
included in the \*(MV (VIRT) amount.

\*(XX.

.TP 4
 8.\fB ENVIRON \*(Em Environment variables \fR
Display all of the environment variables, if any, as seen by the
respective processes.
These variables will be displayed in their raw native order, not the
sorted order you are accustomed to seeing with an unqualified `set'.

\*(NT The ENVIRON field, unlike most columns, is not fixed-width.
When displayed, it plus any other variable width columns will be allocated
all remaining screen width (up to the maximum \*(WX characters).
Even so, such variable width fields could still suffer truncation.
This is especially true for this field.
\*(XT 5c. SCROLLING a Window for additional information on accessing
any truncated data.

.TP 4
 9.\fB Flags \*(Em Task Flags \fR
This column represents the task's current scheduling flags which are
expressed in hexadecimal notation and with zeros suppressed.
These flags are officially documented in <linux/sched.h>.

.TP 4
10.\fB GID \*(Em Group Id \fR
The\fI effective\fR group ID.

.TP 4
11.\fB GROUP \*(Em Group Name \fR
The\fI effective\fR group name.

.TP 4
12.\fB LXC \*(Em Lxc Container Name \fR
The name of the lxc container within which a task is running.
If a process is not running inside a container, a dash (`\-') will be shown.

.TP 4
13.\fB NI \*(Em Nice Value \fR
The nice value of the task.
A negative nice value means higher priority, whereas a positive nice value
means lower priority.
Zero in this field simply means priority will not be adjusted in determining
a task's dispatch-ability.

.TP 4
14.\fB NU \*(Em Last known NUMA node \fR
A number representing the NUMA node associated with the last used processor (`P').
When -1 is displayed it means that NUMA information is not available.

\*(XC `'2' and `3' \*(CIs for additional NUMA provisions affecting the \*(SA.

.TP 4
15.\fB OOMa \*(Em Out of Memory Adjustment Factor \fR
The value, ranging from -1000 to +1000, added to the current out of memory
score (OOMs) which is then used to determine which task to kill when memory
is exhausted.

.TP 4
16.\fB OOMs \*(Em Out of Memory Score \fR
The value, ranging from 0 to +1000, used to select task(s) to kill when memory
is exhausted.
Zero translates to `never kill' whereas 1000 means `always kill'.

.TP 4
17.\fB P \*(Em Last used \*(PU (SMP) \fR
A number representing the last used processor.
In a true SMP environment this will likely change frequently since the kernel
intentionally uses weak affinity.
Also, the very act of running \*(We may break this weak affinity and cause more
processes to change \*(PUs more often (because of the extra demand for
\*(Pu time).

.TP 4
18.\fB PGRP \*(Em Process Group Id \fR
Every process is member of a unique process group which is used for
distribution of signals and by terminals to arbitrate requests for their
input and output.
When a process is created (forked), it becomes a member of the process
group of its parent.
By convention, this value equals the process ID (\*(Xa PID) of the first
member of a process group, called the process group leader.

.TP 4
19.\fB PID \*(Em Process Id \fR
The task's unique process ID, which periodically wraps, though never
restarting at zero.
In kernel terms, it is a dispatchable entity defined by a task_struct.

This value may also be used as: a process group ID (\*(Xa PGRP);
a session ID for the session leader (\*(Xa SID);
a thread group ID for the thread group leader (\*(Xa TGID);
and a TTY process group ID for the process group leader (\*(Xa TPGID).

.TP 4
20.\fB PPID \*(Em Parent Process Id \fR
The process ID (pid) of a task's parent.

.TP 4
21.\fB PR \*(Em Priority \fR
The scheduling priority of the task.
If you see `rt' in this field, it means the task is running
under real time scheduling priority.

Under linux, real time priority is somewhat misleading since traditionally
the operating itself was not preemptible.
And while the 2.6 kernel can be made mostly preemptible, it is not always so.

.TP 4
22.\fB RES \*(Em Resident Memory Size (KiB) \fR
A subset of the virtual address space (VIRT) representing the non-swapped
\*(MP a task is currently using.
It is also the sum of the RSan, RSfd and RSsh fields.

It can include private anonymous pages, private pages mapped to files
(including program images and shared libraries) plus shared anonymous pages.
All such memory is backed by the \*(MS represented separately under SWAP.

Lastly, this field may also include shared file-backed pages which, when
modified, act as a dedicated \*(MS and thus will never impact SWAP.

\*(XX.

.TP 4
23.\fB RSan \*(Em Resident Anonymous Memory Size (KiB) \fR
A subset of resident memory (RES) representing private pages not
mapped to a file.

.TP 4
24.\fB RSfd \*(Em Resident File-Backed Memory Size (KiB) \fR
A subset of resident memory (RES) representing the implicitly shared
pages supporting program images and shared libraries.

The\fI real\fR user ID.

.TP 4
28.\fB RUSER \*(Em Real User Name \fR
The\fI real\fR user name.

.TP 4
29.\fB S \*(Em Process Status \fR
The status of the task which can be one of:
    \fBD\fR = uninterruptible sleep
    \fBI\fR = idle
    \fBR\fR = running
    \fBS\fR = sleeping
    \fBT\fR = stopped by job control signal
    \fBt\fR = stopped by debugger during trace
    \fBZ\fR = zombie

Tasks shown as running should be more properly thought of as ready to run
\*(Em their task_struct is simply represented on the Linux run-queue.
Even without a true SMP machine, you may see numerous tasks in this state
depending on \*(We's delay interval and nice value.

.TP 4
30.\fB SHR \*(Em Shared Memory Size (KiB) \fR
A subset of resident memory (RES) that may be used by other processes.
It will include shared anonymous pages and shared file-backed pages.
It also includes private pages mapped to files representing
program images and shared libraries.

\*(XX.

.TP 4
31.\fB SID \*(Em Session Id \fR
A session is a collection of process groups (\*(Xa PGRP),
usually established by the login shell.
A newly forked process joins the session of its creator.
By convention, this value equals the process ID (\*(Xa PID) of the first
member of the session, called the session leader, which is usually the
login shell.

.TP 4
32.\fB SUID \*(Em Saved User Id \fR
The\fI saved\fR user ID.

.TP 4
33.\fB SUPGIDS \*(Em Supplementary Group IDs \fR
The IDs of any supplementary group(s) established at login or
inherited from a task's parent.
They are displayed in a comma delimited list.

\*(NT The SUPGIDS field, unlike most columns, is not fixed-width.
When displayed, it plus any other variable width columns will be allocated
all remaining screen width (up to the maximum \*(WX characters).
Even so, such variable width fields could still suffer truncation.
\*(XT 5c. SCROLLING a Window for additional information on accessing
any truncated data.

.TP 4
34.\fB SUPGRPS \*(Em Supplementary Group Names \fR
The names of any supplementary group(s) established at login or
inherited from a task's parent.
They are displayed in a comma delimited list.

\*(NT The SUPGRPS field, unlike most columns, is not fixed-width.
When displayed, it plus any other variable width columns will be allocated
all remaining screen width (up to the maximum \*(WX characters).
Even so, such variable width fields could still suffer truncation.

.TP 4
35.\fB SUSER \*(Em Saved User Name \fR
The\fI saved\fR user name.

.TP 4
36.\fB SWAP \*(Em Swapped Size (KiB) \fR
The formerly resident portion of a task's address space written
to the \*(MS when \*(MP becomes over committed.

\*(XX.

.TP 4
37.\fB TGID \*(Em Thread Group Id \fR
The ID of the thread group to which a task belongs.
It is the PID of the thread group leader.
In kernel terms, it represents those tasks that share an mm_struct.

.TP 4
38.\fB TIME \*(Em \*(PU Time \fR
Total \*(PU time the task has used since it started.
When Cumulative mode is \*O, each process is listed with the \*(Pu
time that it and its dead children have used.
You toggle Cumulative mode with `S', which is both a \*(CO and an \*(CI.
\*(XC `S' \*(CI for additional information regarding this mode.

.TP 4
39.\fB TIME+ \*(Em \*(PU Time, hundredths \fR
The same as TIME, but reflecting more granularity through hundredths
of a second.

.TP 4
40.\fB TPGID \*(Em Tty Process Group Id \fR
The process group ID of the foreground process for the connected tty,
or \-1 if a process is not connected to a terminal.
By convention, this value equals the process ID (\*(Xa PID) of the
process group leader (\*(Xa PGRP).

.TP 4
41.\fB TTY \*(Em Controlling Tty \fR
The name of the controlling terminal.
This is usually the device (serial port, pty, etc.) from which the
process was started, and which it uses for input or output.
However, a task need not be associated with a terminal, in which case
you'll see `?' displayed.

.TP 4
42.\fB UID \*(Em User Id \fR
The\fI effective\fR user ID of the task's owner.

.TP 4
43.\fB USED \*(Em Memory in Use (KiB) \fR

It includes all code, data and shared libraries plus pages that have been
swapped out and pages that have been mapped but not used.

\*(XX.

.TP 4
46.\fB WCHAN \*(Em Sleeping in Function \fR
This field will show the name of the kernel function in which the task
is currently sleeping.
Running tasks will display a dash (`\-') in this column.

.TP 4
47.\fB nDRT \*(Em Dirty Pages Count \fR
The number of pages that have been modified since they were last
written to \*(AS.
Dirty pages must be written to \*(AS before the corresponding physical
memory location can be used for some other virtual page.

This field was deprecated with linux 2.6 and is always zero.

.TP 4
48.\fB nMaj \*(Em Major Page Fault Count \fR
The number of\fB major\fR page faults that have occurred for a task.
A page fault occurs when a process attempts to read from or write to a
virtual page that is not currently present in its address space.
A major page fault is when \*(AS access is involved in making that
page available.

.TP 4
49.\fB nMin \*(Em Minor Page Fault count \fR
The number of\fB minor\fR page faults that have occurred for a task.
A page fault occurs when a process attempts to read from or write to a

The Inode of the namespace used to isolate filesystem mount points thus
offering different views of the filesystem hierarchy.

.TP 4
53.\fB nsNET \*(Em NET namespace \fR
The Inode of the namespace used to isolate resources such as network devices,
IP addresses, IP routing, port numbers, etc.

.TP 4
54.\fB nsPID \*(Em PID namespace \fR
The Inode of the namespace used to isolate process ID numbers
meaning they need not remain unique.
Thus, each such namespace could have its own `init/systemd' (PID #1) to
manage various initialization tasks and reap orphaned child processes.

.TP 4
55.\fB nsUSER \*(Em USER namespace \fR
The Inode of the namespace used to isolate the user and group ID numbers.
Thus, a process could have a normal unprivileged user ID outside a user
namespace while having a user ID of 0, with full root privileges, inside
that namespace.

.TP 4
56.\fB nsUTS \*(Em UTS namespace \fR
The Inode of the namespace used to isolate hostname and NIS domain name.
UTS simply means "UNIX Time-sharing System".

.TP 4
57.\fB vMj \*(Em Major Page Fault Count Delta\fR

.SS 4a. GLOBAL Commands
.\" ----------------------------------------------------------------------
The global \*(CIs are\fB always\fR available\fR in both \*(FM and \*(AM.
However, some of these \*(CIs are\fB not available\fR when running
in Secure mode.

If you wish to know in advance whether or not your \*(We has been
secured, simply ask for help and view the system summary on the second
line.

.TP 7
\ \ <\fBEnter\fR> or <\fBSpace\fR>\ \ :\fIRefresh-Display \fR
These commands awaken \*(We and following receipt of any input
the entire display will be repainted.
They also force an update of any hotplugged \*(Pu or \*(MP changes.

Use either of these keys if you have a large delay interval and wish
to see current status,

.TP 7
\ \ \ \fB?\fR | \fBh\fR\ \ :\fIHelp \fR
There are two help levels available.
The first will provide a reminder of all the basic \*(CIs.
If \*(We is\fI secured\fR, that screen will be abbreviated.

Typing `h' or `?' on that help screen will take you to help for
those \*(CIs applicable to \*(AM.

.TP 7
\ \ \ \fB=\fR\ \ :\fIExit-Display-Limits \fR
Removes restrictions on what is shown.
This command will reverse any `i' (idle tasks), `n' (max tasks)
and `v' (hide children) commands that might be active.
It also provides for an exit from PID monitoring, User filtering,
Other filtering, Locate processing and Combine Cpus mode.

Additionally, if the window has been scrolled it will be reset with
this command.

.TP 7
\ \ \ \fB0\fR\ \ :\fIZero-Suppress\fR toggle \fR
This command determines whether zeros are shown or suppressed for many
of the fields in a \*(TW.
Fields like UID, GID, NI, PR or P are not affected by this toggle.

.TP 7
\ \ \ \fBA\fR\ \ :\fIAlternate-Display-Mode\fR toggle \fR
This command will switch between \*(FM and \*(AM.
\*(XT 5. ALTERNATE\-DISPLAY Provisions and the `g' \*(CI for insight
into \*(CWs and \*(FGs.

.TP 7
\ \ \ \fBB\fR\ \ :\fIBold-Disable/Enable\fR toggle \fR
This command will influence use of the bold terminfo capability and
alters\fB both\fR the \*(SA and \*(TA for the \*(CW.
While it is intended primarily for use with dumb terminals, it can be
applied anytime.

\*(NT When this toggle is \*O and \*(We is operating in monochrome mode,
the\fB entire display\fR will appear as normal text.
Thus, unless the `x' and/or `y' toggles are using reverse for emphasis,
there will be no visual confirmation that they are even on.

.TP 7
*\ \ \fBd\fR | \fBs\fR\ \ :\fIChange-Delay-Time-interval \fR
You will be prompted to enter the delay time, in seconds, between
display updates.

Fractional seconds are honored, but a negative number is not allowed.
Entering 0 causes (nearly) continuous updates, with an unsatisfactory
display as the system and tty driver try to keep up with \*(We's demands.
The delay value is inversely proportional to system loading,
so set it with care.

If at any time you wish to know the current delay time, simply ask for
help and view the system summary on the second line.

.TP 7
\ \ \ \fBE\fR\ \ :\fIEnforce-Summary-Memory-Scale\fR in Summary Area
With this command you can cycle through the available \*(SA memory scaling
which ranges from KiB (kibibytes or 1,024 bytes) through EiB (exbibytes or
1,152,921,504,606,846,976 bytes).

If you see a `+' between a displayed number and the following label, it
means that \*(We was forced to truncate some portion of that number.
By raising the scaling factor, such truncation can be avoided.

.TP 7
\ \ \ \fBe\fR\ \ :\fIEnforce-Task-Memory-Scale\fR in Task Area
With this command you can cycle through the available \*(TA memory scaling
which ranges from KiB (kibibytes or 1,024 bytes) through PiB (pebibytes or
1,125,899,906,842,624 bytes).

While \*(We will try to honor the selected target range, additional
scaling might still be necessary in order to accommodate current values.
If you wish to see a more homogeneous result in the memory columns,
raising the scaling range will usually accomplish that goal.
Raising it too high, however, is likely to produce an all zero result
which cannot be suppressed with the `0' \*(CI.

.TP 7
\ \ \ \fBg\fR\ \ :\fIChoose-Another-Window/Field-Group \fR
You will be prompted to enter a number between 1 and 4 designating the
\*(FG which should be made the \*(CW.
You will soon grow comfortable with these 4 windows, especially after
experimenting with \*(AM.

.TP 7
\ \ \ \fBH\fR\ \ :\fIThreads-mode\fR toggle \fR
When this toggle is \*O, individual threads will be displayed for all
processes in all visible \*(TWs.
Otherwise, \*(We displays a summation of all threads in each process.

.TP 7
\ \ \ \fBI\fR\ \ :\fIIrix/Solaris-Mode\fR toggle \fR
When operating in Solaris mode (`I' toggled \*F), a task's \*(Pu usage
will be divided by the total number of \*(PUs.
After issuing this command, you'll be told the new state of this toggle.

.TP 7
*\ \ \fBk\fR\ \ :\fIKill-a-task \fR
You will be prompted for a PID and then the signal to send.

Entering no PID or a negative number will be interpreted as
the default shown in the prompt (the first task displayed).
A PID value of zero means the \*(We program itself.

The default signal, as reflected in the prompt, is SIGTERM.
However, you can send any signal, via number or name.

If you wish to abort the kill process, do one of the following
depending on your progress:
.nf
    1) at the pid prompt, type an invalid number
    2) at the signal prompt, type 0 (or any invalid signal)
    3) at any prompt, type <Esc>
.fi

.TP 7
\ \ \ \fBq\fR\ \ :\fIQuit \fR

.TP 7
*\ \ \fBr\fR\ \ :\fIRenice-a-Task \fR
You will be prompted for a PID and then the value to nice it to.

Entering no PID or a negative number will be interpreted as
the default shown in the prompt (the first task displayed).
A PID value of zero means the \*(We program itself.

A positive nice value will cause a process to lose priority.
Conversely, a negative nice value will cause a process to be viewed
more favorably by the kernel.
As a general rule, ordinary users can only increase the nice value
and are prevented from lowering it.

If you wish to abort the renice process, do one of the following
depending on your progress:
.nf
    1) at the pid prompt, type an invalid number
    2) at the nice prompt, type <Enter> with no input
    3) at any prompt, type <Esc>
.fi

.TP 7
\ \ \ \fBW\fR\ \ :\fIWrite-the-Configuration-File \fR
This will save all of your options and toggles plus the current
display mode and delay time.
By issuing this command just before quitting \*(We, you will be able
restart later in exactly that same state.

.TP 7
\ \ \ \fBX\fR\ \ :\fIExtra-Fixed-Width \fR
Some fields are fixed width and not scalable.
As such, they are subject to truncation which would be indicated
by a `+' in the last position.

This \*(CI can be used to alter the widths of the following fields:

.nf

when operating in \*(FM or the \*(CW name when operating in \*(AM.

.TP 7
\ \ \ \fBt\fR\ \ :\fITask/Cpu-States\fR toggle \fR
This command affects from 2 to many \*(SA lines, depending on the state
of the `1', `2' or `3' \*(CTs and whether or not \*(We is running under
true SMP.

This portion of the \*(SA is also influenced by the `H' \*(CI toggle,
as reflected in the total label which shows either Tasks or Threads.

This command serves as a 4-way toggle, cycling through these modes:

    2. abbreviated user/system and total % + bar graph
    3. abbreviated user/system and total % + block graph
    4. turn off task and cpu states display

\*(XC the `1', `2' and `3' commands below for additional information.

.TP 7
\ \ \ \fBm\fR\ \ :\fIMemory/Swap-Usage\fR toggle \fR
This command affects the two \*(SA lines dealing with physical

This command serves as a 4-way toggle, cycling through these modes:
.nf
    1. detailed percentages by memory type
    2. abbreviated % used/total available + bar graph
    3. abbreviated % used/total available + block graph
    4. turn off memory display
.fi

.TP 7
\ \ \ \fB1\fR\ \ :\fISingle/Separate-Cpu-States\fR toggle \fR
This command affects how the `t' command's Cpu States portion is shown.
Although this toggle exists primarily to serve massively-parallel SMP
machines, it is not restricted to solely SMP environments.

When you see `%Cpu(s):' in the \*(SA, the `1' toggle is \*O and all
\*(Pu information is gathered in a single line.
Otherwise, each \*(Pu is displayed separately as: `%Cpu0, %Cpu1, ...'
up to available screen height.

.TP 7
\ \ \ \fB2\fR\ \ :\fINUMA-Nodes/Cpu-Summary\fR toggle \fR
This command toggles between the `1' command cpu summary display (only)
or a summary display plus the cpu usage statistics for each NUMA Node.
It is only available if a system has the requisite NUMA support.

.TP 7
\ \ \ \fB3\fR\ \ :\fIExpand-NUMA-Node \fR
You will be invited to enter a number representing a NUMA Node.
Thereafter, a node summary plus the statistics for each cpu in that
node will be shown until the `1', `2' or `4' \*(CT is pressed.
This \*(CI is only available if a system has the requisite NUMA support.

.TP 7
\ \ \ \fB4\fR\ \ :\fIDisplay-Cpus-Two-Abreast \fR
This command turns the `1' toggle \*F for individual \*(Pu display
but prints the results two abreast.
It requires a terminal with a minimum width of 80 columns.
If a terminal's width is decreased below the minimum while \*(We
is running, \*(We reverts to the normal `1' toggle \*F state.

To avoid truncation when displaying detailed \*(Pu statistcs,
as opposed to the graphic representations, a minimum width
of 165 columns would be required.

.TP 7
\ \ \ \fB!\fR\ \ :\fICombine-Cpus-Mode \fR
This \*(CT is intended for massively parallel SMP environments where,
even with the `4' \*(CT, not all processors can be displayed.
With each press of `!' the number of additional \*(Pu's combined is
doubled thus reducing the total number of \*(Pu lines displayed.

For example, with the first press of `!' one additional \*(Pu will be
combined and displayed as `0-1, 2-3, ...' instead of the normal
`%Cpu0, %Cpu1, %Cpu2, %Cpu3, ...'.
With a second `!' \*(CT two additional \*(Pus are combined and shown
as `0-2, 3-5, ...'.
Then the third '!' press, combining four additional \*(Pus, shows
as `0-4, 5-9, ...', etc.

Such progression continues until individual \*(Pus are again displayed
and impacts both the `1' and `4' toggles (one or two columns).
Use the `=' command to exit \fBCombine Cpus\fR mode.

.B Input Requirements
.RS +3
.P
When prompted for selection criteria, the data you provide must take one
of two forms.
There are 3 required pieces of information, with a 4th as optional.
These examples use spaces for clarity but your input generally would not.
.nf
        #1           \fB#2\fR  #3              ( required )
        Field\-Name   ?   include\-if\-value
     \fB!\fR  Field\-Name   ?   \fBexclude\fR\-if\-value
     #4                                  ( optional )
.fi

Items #1, #3 and #4 should be self\-explanatory.
Item \fB#2\fR represents both a required \fIdelimiter\fR and the \fIoperator\fR
which must be one of either equality (`=') or relation (`<' or `>').

The `=' equality operator requires only a partial match and that
can reduce your `if\-value' input requirements.
The `>' or `<' relational operators always employ string comparisons,
even with numeric fields.
They are designed to work with a field's default \fIjustification\fR and
with homogeneous data.
When some field's numeric amounts have been subjected to \fIscaling\fR
while others have not, that data is no longer homogeneous.

If you establish a relational filter and you \fBhave\fR changed the
default Numeric or Character \fIjustification\fR, that filter is likely to fail.
When a relational filter is applied to a memory field and you \fBhave not\fR
changed the \fIscaling\fR, it may produce misleading results.
This happens, for example, because `100.0m' (MiB) would appear greater
than `1.000g' (GiB) when compared as strings.

If your filtered results appear suspect, simply altering justification or
scaling may yet achieve the desired objective.
See the `j', `J' and `e' \*(CIs for additional information.

Either of these \fBRES\fR filters might yield inconsistent and/or

are automatically scaled to KiB or above.

.RE

.B Potential Solutions
.RS +3
.P
These examples illustrate how Other Filtering can be creatively
applied to achieve almost any desired result.
Single quotes are sometimes shown to delimit the spaces which are part of
a filter or to represent a request for status (^O) accurately.
But if you used them with if-values in real life, no matches would be found.

Assuming field \fBnTH\fR is displayed, the first filter will result in
only multi-threaded processes being shown.
It also reminds us that a trailing space is part of every displayed field.
The second filter achieves the exact same results with less typing.
.nf
     !nTH=` 1 '                ( ' for clarity only )
     nTH>1                     ( same with less i/p )
.fi

With Forest View mode active and the \fBCOMMAND\fR column in view, this
filter effectively collapses child processes so that just 3 levels are shown.
.nf
     !COMMAND=`       `- '     ( ' for clarity only )
.fi

The final two filters appear as in response to the status request key (^O).
In reality, each filter would have required separate input.
The \fBPR\fR example shows the two concurrent filters necessary to display
tasks with priorities of 20 or more, since some might be negative.
Then by exploiting trailing spaces, the \fBnMin\fR series of filters could
achieve the failed `9999' objective discussed above.
.nf
     `PR>20' + `!PR=-'         ( 2 for right result )

This file is created or updated via the 'W' \*(CI.

The legacy version is written as `$HOME/.your\-name\-4\-\*(We' + `rc'
with a leading period.

A newly created \*(CF is written as procps/your\-name\-4\-\*(We' + `rc'

If a valid absolute path to the rcfile cannot be established, customizations
made to a running \*(We will be impossible to preserve.

.\" ......................................................................
.SS 6b. ADDING INSPECT Entries
.\" ----------------------------------------------------------------------
To exploit the `Y' \*(CI, you must add entries at the\fB end\fR of the
\*(We personal \*(CF.
Such entries simply reflect a file to be read or command/pipeline to be
executed whose results will then be displayed in a separate scrollable,
searchable window.

If you don't know the location or name of your \*(We rcfile, use the `W'
\*(CI to rewrite it and note those details.

Inspect entries can be added with a redirected echo or by editing the \*(CF.
Redirecting an echo risks overwriting the rcfile should it replace (>)
rather than append (>>) to that file.
Conversely, when using an editor care must be taken not to corrupt existing
lines, some of which will contain unprintable data or unusual characters.

Those Inspect entries beginning with a `#' character are ignored, regardless
of content.
Otherwise they consist of the following 3 elements, each of which\fI must\fR
be separated by a tab character (thus 2 `\\t' total):

.nf
  .type:  literal `file' or `pipe'
  .name:  selection shown on the Inspect screen
  .fmts:  string representing a path or command
.fi

The two types of Inspect entries are\fI not\fR interchangeable.
Those designated `\fBfile\fR' will be accessed using fopen and
must reference a single file in the `.fmts' element.
Entries specifying `\fBpipe\fR' will employ popen, their `.fmts' element
could contain many pipelined commands and, none can be interactive.

If the file or pipeline represented in your `.fmts' deals with the specific PID
input or accepted when prompted, then the format string must also contain
the `\fB%d\fR' specifier, as these examples illustrate.

.nf
  .fmts=  /proc/\fI%d\fR/numa_maps
  .fmts=  lsof -P -p\fI %d\fR
.fi

For `\fBpipe\fR' type entries only, you may also wish to redirect stderr to
stdout for a more comprehensive result.
Thus the format string becomes:

.nf
  .fmts=  pmap -x %d\fI 2>&1\fR
.fi

Here are examples of both types of Inspect entries as they might appear
in the rcfile.
The first entry will be ignored due to the initial `#' character.
For clarity, the pseudo tab depictions (^I) are surrounded by an
extra space but the actual tabs would not be.
.nf

  # pipe ^I Sockets ^I lsof -n -P -i 2>&1
  pipe ^I Open Files ^I lsof -P -p %d 2>&1
  file ^I NUMA Info ^I /proc/%d/numa_maps
  pipe ^I Log ^I tail -n100 /var/log/syslog | sort -Mr
.fi

Except for the commented entry above, these next examples show what could
be echoed to achieve similar results, assuming the rcfile name was `.toprc'.
However, due to the embedded tab characters, each of these lines should be
preceded by `\fB/bin/echo \-e\fR', not just a simple an `echo', to
enable backslash interpretation regardless of which shell you use.

.nf
  "pipe\\tOpen Files\\tlsof -P -p %d 2>&1" >> ~/.toprc
  "file\\tNUMA Info\\t/proc/%d/numa_maps" >> ~/.toprc
  "pipe\\tLog\\ttail -n200 /var/log/syslog | sort -Mr" >> ~/.toprc
.fi

If any inspect entry you create produces output with unprintable characters
they will be displayed in either the ^C notation or hexadecimal <FF> form,
depending on their value.
This applies to tab characters as well, which will show as `^I'.
If you want a truer representation, any embedded tabs should be expanded.
The following example takes what could have been a `file' entry but employs
a `pipe' instead so as to expand the embedded tabs.

.nf
  # next would have contained `\\t' ...
  # file ^I <your_name> ^I /proc/%d/status
  # but this will eliminate embedded `\\t' ...
  pipe ^I <your_name> ^I cat /proc/%d/status | expand \-
.fi

\*(NT Some programs might rely on \fISIGINT\fR to end.
Therefore, if a `\fBpipe\fR' such as the following is established, one must
use Ctrl-C to terminate it in order to review the results.
This is the single occasion where a `^C' will not also terminate \*(We.

.nf
  pipe ^I Trace ^I /usr/bin/strace -p %d 2>&1
.fi

Lastly, while `\fBpipe\fR' type entries have been discussed in terms of pipelines
and commands, there is nothing to prevent you from including \fI shell scripts\fR
as well.
Perhaps even newly created scripts designed specifically for the `Y' \*(CI.

For example, as the number of your Inspect entries grows over time, the `Options:'
row will be truncated when screen width is exceeded.
That does not affect operation other than to make some selections invisible.
However, if some choices are lost to truncation but you want to see more options,
there is an easy solution hinted at below.

.nf
  Inspection Pause at pid ...
  Use:  left/right then <Enter> ...
  Options:  help  1  2  3  4  5  6  7  8  9  10  11 ...
.fi

The entries in the \*(We rcfile would have a number for the `.name' element and
the `help' entry would identify a shell script you've written explaining what
those numbered selections actually mean.
In that way, many more choices can be made visible.
