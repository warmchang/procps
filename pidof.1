.SH NAME
pidof -- find the process ID of a running program
.SH SYNOPSIS
.B pidof
.RB [ \-s ]
.RB [ \-c ]
.RB [ \-q ]
.RB [ \-w ]
.RB [ \-x ]
.RB [ \-o
.IR omitpid[,omitpid...]... ]
.RB [ \-S

.B program
.RB [ program... ]
.SH DESCRIPTION
.B Pidof
finds the process id's (pids) of the named programs. It prints those
id's on the standard output.
.SH OPTIONS
.IP \-s
Single shot - this instructs the program to only return one \fIpid\fP.
.IP \-c
Only return process ids that are running with the same root directory.
This option is ignored for non-root users, as they will be unable to check
the current root directory of processes they do not own.
.IP \-q
Quiet mode, suppress any output and only sets the exit status accordingly.
.IP \-w
Show also processes that do not have visible command line (e.g. kernel
worker threads).
.IP \-x
Scripts too - this causes the program to also return process id's of
shells running the named scripts.
.IP "-o \fIomitpid\fP"
Tells \fIpidof\fP to omit processes with that process id. The special
pid \fB%PPID\fP can be used to name the parent process of the \fIpidof\fP
program, in other words the calling shell or shell script.
.IP "-S \fIseparator\fP"
Use \fIseparator\fP as a separator put between pids. Used only when
more than one pids are printed for the program.
The \fB\-d\fR option is an alias for this option for sysvinit
.B pidof
compatibility.
.SH "EXIT STATUS"
.TP
.B 0
At least one program was found with the requested name.
.TP
.B 1
No program was found with the requested name.

.SH BUGS
When using the \fI\-x\fP option,
.B pidof
only has a simple method for detecting scripts and will miss scripts that,
for example, use env. This limitation is due to how the scripts look in
the proc filesystem.
